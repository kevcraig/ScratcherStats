# Scrape North Carolina Scratch-Off Data

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

R code to scrape current scratch-off ticket metadata, counts, and odds
from the NC Lottery (<https://nclottery.com/Home>) website. This is the
main data collection method used for
<https://kevcraig.github.io/ScratcherStatsNC>. Resulting data is stored
in flat lists and lists of dataframes.

## ScratcherStatsNC

I use this code in part to populate my website
<https://kevcraig.github.io/ScratcherStatsNC> shown below. ![Seasonal
